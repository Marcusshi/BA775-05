The exploratory analysis is organised into three themes: ridership trends over time, ride characteristics and user behaviour, and weather and seasonal effects. Within each theme we pose concrete questions and use SQL queries on the cleaned tables to answer them. The examples below illustrate the process; your notebook should execute the SQL and display the results so that you can validate assumptions and spot anomalies."

        "   Action: Increase dock counts and e-bike inventory at these hubs, set higher priority rebalancing loops, and designate nearby overflow stations to absorb surges.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Most trips are under 20 minutes, with a large peak at 6–10 minutes.**\n",
        "   Action: Tune pricing and messaging around short, quick trips; ensure fast turn-around at high-throughput docks; schedule maintenance and rebalancing outside these peak windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Casual riders make many more round trips than members.**\n",
        "   Action: Add visitor-friendly features at tourist and campus hubs (clear return guidance, loop suggestions, wayfinding), and run targeted conversion offers that nudge frequent casuals to memberships.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Top origin–destination flows cluster within a small area around MIT, Central, and Beacon.**\n",
        "   Action: Create micro-rebalancing circuits between these specific station pairs, pre-position e-bikes for the dominant directions, and pilot dynamic caps on dock availability to keep return capacity open.\n",

        "5. **Members deliver the majority of volume and skew to one-way, commute-style rides.**\n",

        "\n",
        "6. **Average trip times shorten under windy, rainy, or snowy conditions.** Action: riders prefer favor quick, necessity-based trips instead of leisure rides, so optimize rebalancing cycles for short-duration turnover; delay maintenance dispatches until calmer weather conditions.\n",

        "7. **Hazardous weather correlates with higher late-return and maintenance events.**\n",
